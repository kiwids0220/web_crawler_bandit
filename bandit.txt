-----------------Bandit Level 0-----------------
The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH.
The host to which you need to connect is
bandit.labs.overthewire.org, on port 2220.
The username is bandit0 and the password is bandit0. Once
logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level
1.


========****** command you need to solve this level ******========
ssh


-----------------Bandit Level 1-----------------
The password for the next level is stored in a file called
readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log
into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level,
use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.


========****** command you need to solve this level ******========
ls, cd, cat, file, du, find


-----------------Bandit Level 2-----------------

========****** command you need to solve this level ******========
ls, cd, cat, file, du, find


-----------------Bandit Level 5-----------------
The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable
file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed
up, try the “reset” command.

grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd


-----------------Bandit Level 12-----------------
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt,
where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been
rotated by 13 positions


========****** command you need to solve this level ******========
grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd


-----------------Bandit Level 13-----------------
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt,
which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed.
For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in
which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123.
Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the
manpages!)


========****** command you need to solve this level ******========
grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd, mkdir,cp, mv, file


-----------------Bandit Level 14-----------------
The password for the next level is stored in
/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user
bandit14. For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you
get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level.
Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine
you are working on


========****** command you need to solve this level ******========
ssh, telnet, nc, openssl, s_client, nmap


-----------------Bandit Level 15-----------------
The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the
password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.


========****** command you need to solve this level ******========
ssh, telnet, nc, openssl, s_client, nmap


-----------------Bandit Level 16-----------------
The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the
password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using
SSL encryption.
Helpful note: Getting “HEARTBEATING” and “Read R BLOCK”? Use
-ign_eof and read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage.
Next to ‘R’ and ‘Q’, the ‘B’ command also works in this version of
that command…


========****** command you need to solve this level ******========
ssh, telnet, nc, openssl, s_client, nmap


-----------------Bandit Level 17-----------------
The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the
password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range
31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server
listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which
donâ€™t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the
others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.


========****** command you need to solve this level ******========
ssh, telnet, nc, openssl, s_client, nmap


-----------------Bandit Level 18-----------------
There are 2 files in the homedirectory: passwords.old and
passwords.new. The password for the next level is in
passwords.new and is the only line that has been changed between
passwords.old and passwords.new
NOTE: if you have solved this level and see ‘Byebye!’ when trying
to log into bandit18, this is related to the next level, bandit19


========****** command you need to solve this level ******========
cat, grep, ls, diff


-----------------Bandit Level 19-----------------
The password for the next level is stored in a file readme in
the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified .bashrc
to log you out when you log in with SSH.


========****** command you need to solve this level ******========
ssh, ls, cat


-----------------Bandit Level 20-----------------
To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary
in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how
to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual
place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.

========****** command you need to solve this level ******========



-----------------Bandit Level 21-----------------
There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the
following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you
specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from
the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level
(bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the
password for the next level (bandit21).
NOTE: Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it
works as you think


========****** command you need to solve this level ******========
ssh, nc, cat, bash, screen, tmux, Unix ‘job control’ (bg, fg, jobs, &, CTRL-Z, …)


-----------------Bandit Level 22-----------------
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from
cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for
the configuration and see what command is being executed.


========****** command you need to solve this level ******========
cron, crontab, crontab(5) (use “man 5 crontab” to access this)


-----------------Bandit Level 23-----------------
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from
cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for
the configuration and see what command is being executed.
NOTE: Looking at shell scripts written by other people is a
very useful skill. The script for this level is intentionally made
easy to read. If you are having problems understanding what it does,
try executing it to see the debug information it prints.


========****** command you need to solve this level ******========
cron, crontab, crontab(5) (use “man 5 crontab” to access this)


-----------------Bandit Level 24-----------------
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from
cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for
the configuration and see what command is being executed.
NOTE: This level requires you to create your own first
shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of
yourself when you beat this level!
NOTE 2: Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once
executed, so you may want to keep a copy around…


========****** command you need to solve this level ******========
cron, crontab, crontab(5) (use “man 5 crontab” to access this)


-----------------Bandit Level 25-----------------
A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for
bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode.
There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000
combinations, called brute-forcing.

========****** command you need to solve this level ******========



-----------------Bandit Level 26-----------------
Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easyâ€¦
The shell for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else.
Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.


========****** command you need to solve this level ******========
ssh, cat, more, vi, ls, id, pwd


-----------------Bandit Level 27-----------------
Good job getting a shell! Now hurry and grab the password for bandit27!


========****** command you need to solve this level ******========
ls


-----------------Bandit Level 28-----------------
There is a git repository at ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo. The password for the user bandit27-git is the same as for the user bandit27.
Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.


========****** command you need to solve this level ******========
git


-----------------Bandit Level 29-----------------
There is a git repository at ssh://bandit28-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo. The password for the user bandit28-git is the same as for the user bandit28.
