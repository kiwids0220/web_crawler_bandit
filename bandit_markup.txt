<div><p>The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the
password of the current level to <strong>a port on localhost in the range
31000 to 32000</strong>. First find out which of these ports have a server
listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which
donâ€™t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the
others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.</p>

to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual
place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.</p>

Bandit Level 21

<div><p>There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the
following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you
specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from
the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level
(bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the
password for the next level (bandit21).</p>

very useful skill. The script for this level is intentionally made
easy to read. If you are having problems understanding what it does,
try executing it to see the debug information it prints.</p>

shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of
yourself when you beat this level!</p>

<p><strong>NOTE 2:</strong> Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once
executed, so you may want to keep a copy around…</p>

bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode.
